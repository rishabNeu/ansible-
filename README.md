# ansible-
###Playing with Ansible &amp; some configurations / boilerplate


## 🍀 First things first
- Configure `SSH keys` 
- Install ssh key pair -> `public and private`
- Keep the __private__ on the workstation that the Ansible will use to ssh to other servers
- `Dump/ copy` the **public key** to all the other servers to which the main ansible machine is going to talk to.

## 💾 Inventory file
- Add all the `IP` or `Hostnames` of the server you want ansible to connect to and work with
-
